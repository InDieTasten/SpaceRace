Technical Concept
=================

These decisions have been made by the team:

- Create a 2D game, because nobody of the team is familiar enough with 3D assets.

- Use C#, because we are all very familiar with it.

- Use Unity, as it popular, has a large ecosystem, and supports C# scripting as first class citizen.

- Use a fixed aspect ratio for the game, because UI design and layouting would explode in effort otherwise.

- Use 16:9 aspect ratio, because that's the most common.

- Use mouse and keyboard for input devices (Reason?)

- Make sure the game design could be ported to gamepad's in the future (Reason?)
