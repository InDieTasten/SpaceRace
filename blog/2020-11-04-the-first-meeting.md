Yesterday we kicked off our project by sharing our ideas for the moonshot theme.
It was really quite fun to play around with so many ideas.

It was quite clear though, that we didn't have much of a plan on how to even get started on developing a game. Yet alone developing it in as a team effort.

Do we decide engine first, then ideas, or ideas, then engines. Maybe we should try a couple engines, and more ideas might come up. It was really quite messy.

Paul shared some of his experience developing some stuff in Unreal and Unity, and guided us to take the following approach:

1. Decide on a concrete idea for the game (mechanic needs to build rocket for race to the moon)
2. Select between 2D/3D technology (2D)
3. Select engine (Unity)
4. Try engine with tutorials fitting the theme or mechanics of our idea (Split different portions of idea to try across the team members)

As nobody really stepped up to take any form of leadership, we've decided everything by voting. I am personally happy with what we came up with. I also think initially, it is especially important to be inclusive, so that we have a goal that we all like to work towards. We ended up taking an idea that I came up with, which leads me to an issue I want to address:

I feel like I might overpower other team members at the moment. I'd like to address this in the next meetup to clarify, that I tend to be quite dominant in technical discussions, and that it does not equate to me being right.

The most fitting emotion I have with this project is currently "excited".
It's really cool to see people come together to create something as a team. Just because they like create, or want to learn a new thing out of curiosity.

I have not much else to say for now, so sincerely
